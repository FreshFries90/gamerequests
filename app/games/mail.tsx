my name is Stefan Fries. I'm the host of the german YouTube and Twitch-Channel FreshFries. You can find my Channels here: https://YouTube.com/FreshFries and on https://Twitch.tv/FreshFries. I would like to review ${gameName} on my Channels. Can you send me one or two keys of your game to start it? The second key would be for a little raffle for my community.

Best regards,
Stefan Fries`);
